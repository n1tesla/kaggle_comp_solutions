    "Extracting the target series together with the static covariates.¶\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we convert our data for forecasting with Darts, there is a need to identify the type of models to use. Traditional statistical models like ARIMA are focused on forecasting a single target series per model. As we have 1782 target series, building 1782 models can be computationally expensive. This is where the concept of global models comes in, allowing a single model to forecast multiple target series by making use of shared information.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, using a single model can make it challenging to represent all relevant variables accurately. A compromise would be to use multiple models, where each model forecasts a specific group of target series. It then makes sense for each group of target series to be similar in nature, allowing the models to capture the unique patterns within each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to group the target series. From our findings above, the problems of zero sales and leading zeros could be related to the type of products sold, suggesting that each product has its unique characteristics. As such, a reasonable approach would be to have one model per product family, so we have a total of 33 models.\n",

    "For the static covariates, we have identified the city, state, cluster, type, store_nbr, family columns. Since we are grouping the target series by product family, we can drop the family column."

    "Our forecasting horizon (forecast_horizon) is set to be 16 days, which is equal to the length of our test data. To evaluate our models, we will be performing time series cross-validation using a rolling forecasting origin. How this works is that we repeatedly build a training set expanding from the beginning of the target series. For each training set, the next 16 days (our forecasting horizon) will be our validation set. This process continues until we reach the end of the target series. The performance of the model is determined by the average RMSLE score across all the validation sets. A more detailed description of how this works can be found in this online textbook.\n",
    "We have pointed out earlier that there are some target series with many trailing zeros, which could be due to consistent poor sales performance or product unavailability. As such, generating zero forecasts for such target series is a logical choice. We set a window size (zero_fc_window) that determines the number of previous days to check for zero sales in the configuration below.\n",

Some evidence to support this would be the great fluctuations in the count of zero sales between 2014 and 2015, which are not observed in other time periods. Also, there are zero promotion values up till early 2014. These findings suggest that there could be structural changes in that time period. As such, using the entire data without accounting for such changes may break our models. The recent data may be more reliable for forecasting compared to the older data.
